The following is a list of known bugs with SETools.

* If you are using Python 3.5 and see errors like this:

  SystemError: <built-in function delete_qpol_iterator_t> returned a result with an error set

  This is a bug in the wrapper generated by SWIG.  This has been seen on
  SWIG versions 2.0.12 and 3.0.7.  Upgrading to SWIG 3.0.8+ and rebuilding
  SETools should address this issue.

* A bug in NetworkX 1.8+ will output the following message to stderr if a type
  is valid, but not a node in a domain transition or information flow graph:

  'Type' object is not iterable

  This message may be seen multiple times at the end of running unit tests.
