*setools-4.1.0-rc (11 Dec 2016)

  Library:
  * Implemented support for alternate install prefixes.
  * Implemented support for building setools with a locally-built libsepol.
  * Fixed an sediff bug with unioning rules after expansion.
  * Improved sediff memory usage.
  * Patch from Nicolas Iooss to make more stable output in TE rule permission lists.
  * Replaced string representations (e.g. rule types) with enumerations.
    Requires the enum34 (not enum) Python package if using Python < 3.4.

  Apol:
  * Implemented context menu option for exporting the information flow
    and domain transition analysis tree browser views.
  * Implemented CSV export of table results.
  * Implemented (clipboard) copy from table results.
  * Added missing "clear" button in object class query.
  * Implemented save/load settings for tabs.
  * Implemented save/load workspace (save all tabs settings).
  * Fixed include/exclude type dialog to keep its place when
    adding or removing types from an analysis.
  * Implemented filter on include/exclude type dialog to filter
    the lists by attribute.


*setools-4.0.1 (17 May 2016)

  Library:
  * Fixed a compile error on 32bit systems.
  * Changed domain transition analysis output to use lists instead
    of generators.  This fixes a display problem in apol's DTA browser.

  Apol:
  * Replaced icons with stock Qt icons to remove license issues
    with some distributions.

  Sesearch:
  * Changed xperm options to bring in line with sediff, e.g. --allowx
    changed to --allowxperm.  Python's argument parser will still detect
    --allowx as an abbreviation of --allowxperm, so compatibility is preserved.


*setools-4.0.0 (04 May 2016)

  First 4.0 release.  SETools is reimplemented in Python.
