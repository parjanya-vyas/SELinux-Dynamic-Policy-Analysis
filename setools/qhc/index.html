<h1>Apol SELinux Policy Analysis</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This file contains basic help information for using apol, a graphical
policy analysis tool for Security Enhanced (SELinux) policies.  The
tool provides the ability to:</p>

<ol>
<li>
Examine, search, and relate policy components (types, type
attributes, object classes, object permissions, roles, users,
initials SIDs, MLS components, network and file system contexts,
and booleans), and policy rules.</li>

<li>Perform some automated analysis of policies, including forward and
reverse domain transition analyses, and information flow analysis.</li>
</ol>

<p>Apol supports source, and binary policies. Certain apol features may
be disabled if the underlying policy does not support the action.  For
example, rule searches will not report line numbers when searching
monolithic binary polices.

<p>Apol provides compatibility with the current and previous policy
syntax.  It supports analysis of policy versions 15 and up.</p>


<h2>Menus</h2>
<p>Use <b>Open</b> from the <b>File</b> menu to open a valid policy.
Only one policy can be open at a time; opening a second policy will
result in the first being closed.</p>

<p>The <b>Permission Map</b> menu allows for opening, editing,
and saving <a href="infoflow.html#permmap">permission mappings</a>.
These are used by apol's <a href="infoflow.html">information flow analysis</a>.</p>

<h2>Starting an Analysis</h2>
<p>To begin analyzing a policy, click the new analysis button.
A menu of available analysis tools will be presented.  Select one, and
a new analysis tab will open.  Any analysis can be started multiple
times, and each will operate independently, so multiple concurrent
analyses can be performed.  To help manage multiple tabs, the tabs can be
renamed by double-click the tab.</p>
